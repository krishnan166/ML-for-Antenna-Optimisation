# ML-for-Antenna-Optimisation
It is very important to optimise the design parameters in case of an antenna design. <br>
Machine learning algorithms are a really advanced way to work on the feature optimisation of antenna designs.<br>
The dataset has been generated using ANSYS HFSS FW simulation software.<br>
The considered antennas are for Sub 6GHz 5G NR
